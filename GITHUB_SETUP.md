## Reminder

To update or generate your HTML site, remember to run:

	./generate_html_ps.ps1

Use this PowerShell script whenever you want to refresh or rebuild your site files.
- Split saves into smaller archives
- Host on a different platform like Netlify or AWS S3

## Regenerating the Website

If you add new saves, just run the script again:
```powershell
.\generate_site.ps1
```

Then commit and push to GitHub.
